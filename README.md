## Project team:

## In this project we answered these questions:

### 1- What is the content distribution on Netflix movies vs TV shows?
### 2- Is the majority content on Netflix made for adults or kids?
### 3- Which year was the highest release quantity contents on Netflix?
### 4- What are the countries with more content realased?
##

## We structured this project in the following sections:

### 1 - DATA EXPLORATION
### 2 - DATA CLEANING
### 3 - DATA VISUALIZATION (without USA and only USA)
## 

## In data exploration we tried to understand the dataset looking the columns name, size, data types and data in general. Here are some examples of data exploration we used:

## In data cleaning we splitted the multiple values we found in the columns country and genre and merge those datasets back to the main dataset plus, some small ajustments for a better understand of this dataset. Here are some examples of data cleaning:
