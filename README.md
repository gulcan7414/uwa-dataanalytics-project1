**In this project we answered these questions:**

1- How is the content distribution on Netflix between movies and TV shows?

2- Is the majority content on Netflix made for adults or kids?

3- In which year did Netflix release the highest quantity of content?

4- What are the countries that have released the most content on Netflix?

**We structured this project in the following sections:**

**1 - DATA EXPLORATION**

**2 - DATA CLEANING**

**3 - DATA VISUALIZATION (without USA and only USA)**
## 

**In data exploration we tried to understand the dataset looking the columns name, size, data types and data in general. Here are some examples of data exploration we used:**

**In data cleaning we splitted the multiple values we found in the columns country and genre and merge those datasets back to the main dataset plus, some small ajustments for a better understand of this dataset. Here are some examples of data cleaning:**
